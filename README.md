### About the hack

<details>
  <summary>INTRO</summary>
  I'm Watson, the creator of ARTHUR LABS. We are developing a fully open sourced marketplace boilerplate that reduces the time it takes for ideators to bring their ideas to Web3 by 94%, from 6-12 months to 1 week.

Our test case in this hackathon is CLODA DOT (Derived from the Latan term KODADOT and the Midwestern term POLKADOT, mixed using Ancient greek terms CLODA, meaning Clothes. Sorry, I'm a nerd.)

CLODA DOT is a marketplace for clothes.
