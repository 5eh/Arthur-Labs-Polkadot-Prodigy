### INTRODUCTION

This section of the code stack lets you totally customize this marketplace, you have a selection of 3 Contracts type, with these, your marketplace will automatically adjust to your idea: 

`Commerce` - Establish a marketplace where anyone can purchase, or sell a specific product.

`Service`- Establish a marketplace where anyone can purchase, or sell a specific service. 

`Delivery` - Establish a marketplace where anyone can have any package delivered, or drive to earn.

There are countless usecases. I believe I had around 33 use cases written in 10 minutes.




### Quick start

1. Adjust Index.js - Determine your branding, purpose, adjust the vocabulary (This will basically just rearchitect the boilerplate to your liking_
* Consider if you want to enable a traditional marketplace only, or integrate Polkadot contracts inside.

2. Adjust Styles.js - Determine the design system, color scheme and UX/UI experience. Primary color will ultimately decide the entire color stack, I would recommend you just play with this until it's cool.

3. Adjust Form.js - This is the form architecture for your marketplace, some marketplaces require a unique set up, so this is where you can adjust the links, form structures and data handling. More technical.
